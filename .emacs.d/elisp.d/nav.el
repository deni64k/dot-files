;; Nav is a lightweight solution for Emacs users who want something like
;; TextMate's file browser, or the Eclipse project view. Unlike these two,
;; Nav only shows the contents of a single directory at a time, but it allows
;; recursive searching for filenames using the 'f' key-binding, and recursive
;; grepping of file contents with the 'g' key-binding.
